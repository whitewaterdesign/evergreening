  notes: '- The new per-request isolation in shared FastAPI processes may impact deployment
    or multi-agent workflow architecture (v2.3.26)

    - Feature restricting tool access to within base directories could break workflows
    relying on broader access unless opt-out is configured (v2.3.24)

    - Major new capabilities like unified agent learning and remote agents may require
    review of configuration settings or system architecture (introduced in v2.3.25,
    v2.3.17)'
